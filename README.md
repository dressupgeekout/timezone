# timezone

This is a simple shell script which lets users administer a Unix-like
system's timezone.

It is intended to be a portable, common interface to list, get and/or set
all timezones on a system.

Note that so far, it's been tested to do the right thing only on NetBSD...
patches are very welcome!
